# APRIMON TRACKER

Most people who shiny breed pokemon in apriballs have a huge elaborate spreadsheet to keep track of them, either for their own reference or for trades. For example, the one I was using in Shield is available [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1YAkiDVXd9OIotCvpKUfOZfbEQPMMDaYy5m7S3YeXJNk/edit?usp=sharing). While these spreadsheets can be an interesting demonstration of the widely varying data preferences of the community, I wanted to do something different for myself and my friends. In the summer of 2023, I created [an app using pure vanilla JavaScript](https://github.com/tristan-remple/aprimon). Looking back on it, that was insane. So this is my second effort, using JavaScript frameworks including express, react, and redux.

## Goals

- Implement the same functionality or better, using a more modern technology stack
- Build an app that is accessible and secure
- Implement user registration and switching
- Stretch goal: multiple themes
